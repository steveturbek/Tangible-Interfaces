# "Hacky Bird"

Design Brief: design and produce a tangible interface that creatively interprets the video game [Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/) in the real world using physical sensors and output, but without a screen. The project will include design, electronics, programming, & prototyping of a ‘works like’ model.
