# Tangible Interfaces

This page contains the materials for the Tangible Interfaces Senior Industrial Design Studio at Pratt Institute, created by [Steve Turbek](https://turbek.com) in 2025.

The studio focuses on designing with tactile and sensory components to build interactive user experiences embodied in physical products. The studio is built around on iterative making with extensive use of 3D modeling and printing.
It will introduce basic electronics using the BBC Microbit, a very simple computer board with a rich sensor package and excellent introductory software. No previous experience of UX or electronics is expected.

We explore the theory and practices of the User Experience Design Process in the context of physical design. Our objects must not only be beautiful, we must have the open mindset to validate our designs with users to improve them.

### Tangible Interfaces are an opportunity for designers

”Software is eating the world” [claimed Marc Andreessen in 2011](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). Its all-consuming hunger is ravaging the product design landscape. Many consumer products, from camera to Walkman to in-car controls are now simply apps on a featureless glass oblong. This leads to bland product design and customer dissatisfaction. In car design, this has even become a safety concern. “Physical buttons are increasingly rare in modern cars The driver in the worst-performing car control system needs four times longer to perform simple tasks than in the best-performing” [link](https://www.vibilagare.se/english/physical-buttons-outperform-touchscreens-new-cars-test-finds)

An era where “everything is an app and all apps look the same” is also an opportunity for industrial designers to create innovative new products. In Tangible Interfaces, the student is invited to think beyond the screen and design for touch, hearing, and the [dozens of other senses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense) that people have.
