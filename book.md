# Tangible Interfaces Book Proposal

## Intended Audience

UX designers who want to build job skills, prototype a startup product, or simply have fun hacking to expand their understanding of how interaction design applies, and differs, in the real world.

## Elevator Pitch

Like in the book "Flatland", UX design has been trapped in a 2 dimensional world of glowing rectangles, yet a fascinating "third" dimensional world exists for designers to explore. This book introduces "Tangible Interface Design", or UX Design for the real world.

This book takes a strategic overview of designing interactive physical products, from what made the iPod successful to why safety studies show touchscreens make cars more dangerous. In an era where so many products are just apps and so many apps look the same, Tangible Interface design shows how physical design can engage all our human senses to create delightful products.

The book surveys the opportunities and issues for designing smart objects, from home electronics to vehicle design. Each chapter covers a strategic industrial design issue, which is illustrated with a practical how-to guide for prototyping a physical interface. Examples include real world accessibility and ergonomics, to interpreting ambiguous sensor data.

Prototyping interaction has been challenging for the designer due to the complexity of software. Today's AI, properly used with techniques demonstrated in this book, can empower the designer to take on complex hardware and software challenges including working with data.

The book is designed to work with an open source educational kit of electronics sensors and motors, each with step-by-step instructions that make getting started easily, no coding or electronics experience expected. This book hopes to share the fun of expanding UX design in the real world; the focus is on prototyping, not final electronic engineering, but advanced directions for learning are provided.

## Placeholder Book Structure

### Introduction

- Why physical computing matters for UX designers
- What's new/different compared to screen-only UX
- Who this book is for (hobbyists, prototypers, startup idea folks)

### Foundations

- What is physical computing (sensors, actuators, embedded systems) — basics
- Key UX principles when you go physical (affordance, ergonomics, context, feedback loops)
- The physical-digital interface: bridging hardware + software + UI

### Prototyping Tools & Materials

- Microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, prototyping boards (Arduino, Pi etc)
- Fabrication / materials / 3D printing / wearables / IoT hardware
- Tools UX designers can use (without being full engineers)

### Interaction Design for Physical Devices

- Designing for movement, space, physical gestures
- Feedback modalities: haptics, sound, light, mechanical motion
- Contextual & environmental factors (lighting, noise, user movement)
- Accessibility & inclusivity in physical computing

### UX Research & Testing in Physical Prototypes

- How to test physical prototypes with users
- Iteration cycles: build → test → refine
- Low-fidelity physical prototypes vs high-fidelity, when and how

### From Prototype to Product / Startup Mindset

- Validating ideas cheaply
- MVPs for physical computing systems
- Scaling from hobby prototype to product / manufacturing basics
- Business/UX strategy side: understanding users, costs, contexts

### Case Studies / Project Walk-throughs

- Example hobby/startup projects: what they did, UX decisions, hardware decisions
- Lessons learnt

### Future Directions

- Emerging materials, sensors, spatial computing, ambient computing
- The intersection with IoT, wearables, spatial/3D computing
- Where hobbyist + startup prototypes are going

### Appendices / Resources

- Recommended reading (books, blogs, YouTube)
- Tutorials & starter kits
- Glossary of hardware/UX terms
